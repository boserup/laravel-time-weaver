# Laravel Time Weaver
A small footprint package designed for seamlessly tracking and logging the response time of external HTTP requests
within your Laravel applications. Inspired by the realms of science fiction, this package acts as a temporal guardian,
meticulously recording and analyzing the chronicles of your application's interactions with the vast digital cosmos.

## Installation
```bash
composer require boserup/laravel-time-weaver
```

## Getting Started
1. **Configure AWS Credentials:**
   Set the following environment variables to configure AWS credentials:
    - `AWS_REGION`: Your AWS region.
    - `CLOUDWATCH_KEY`: Your CloudWatch access key.
    - `CLOUDWATCH_SECRET`: Your CloudWatch secret key.

2. **Customize Metric Namespace:**
   If you wish to change the default metric namespace from "LaravelTimeWeaver," set the `TIME_WEAVER_METRIC_NAMESPACE`
   environment variable.

3. **Adjust Metric Name:**
   To modify the default metric name from "ExternalHttpResponseTime," set the `TIME_WEAVER_METRIC_NAME` environment
   variable.

4. **Toggle Logging for all hosts:**
   By default Laravel Time Weaver will log the response time for all outgoing requests. Toggle this behaviour by setting
   the `TIME_WEAVER_LOG_ALL_HOSTS` environment variable. If set to `false`, you'll need to publish the configuration
   file to define the list of allowed hosts.

   ```bash
   php artisan vendor:publish --tag=time-weaver-config
   ```
